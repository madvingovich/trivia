# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) TS template.

## Description

`src/app` contains redux related code.

`src/components` contains common components that can be used through the application (buttons, inputs, etc.).

`src/hooks` contains common hooks.

`src/pages` contains pages folders and some common styles modules, each folder contains page container itself, personal `components` folder, `utils` file if requied.

CSS modules methodology is used here, every component that has some styles has `*.module.css` file located next to it.
